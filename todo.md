## Set the bk of the app to match the color of pocket and the fin timestamp

## Add tags to the email template

## Create a list of badges for all the tags on the listing page.

## Make the listings page the default home page.

## On the preview summary page, add some tooling to have AI generate the summary for it so we can test in staging and iterate fast on different ideas.

## On the daily summary page, includea button at the top that will send the email to me.

## Normalize the timestamp situation, just create it in the cloud function and don't reference it from pocket

## Add user login and auth to the app.
